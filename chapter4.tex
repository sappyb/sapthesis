\chapter{Design and Evaluation of Techniques for HPC platforms with SDN-capable Interconnects} 
In this work, I explore the integration of software-defined networking (SDN) into high performance computing (HPC) systems, with a focus on adapting SDN mechanisms to the distinct communication characteristics of HPC applications.

This investigation is motivated by the widespread success of SDN in domains such as data centers, campus networks, and wide-area networks, where it has demonstrated significant improvements in traffic management and network resource optimization through features like logically centralized control, per-flow management, and programmability. Prior studies, including those by Kreutz et al.\ and He et al., have shown how SDN can optimize Internet and data-parallel workloads through dynamic reconfiguration and intelligent traffic steering.

These efforts, while impactful, primarily target Internet and data-parallel applications characterized by coarse-grained, irregular traffic patterns, and fall short in addressing the repetitive communication phases inherent to HPC workloads. As a result, conventional SDN techniques, when applied to HPC systems, often incur prohibitive overheads due to their inability to react efficiently to short-duration, phase-driven communication behavior. Consequently, SDN remains underutilized in HPC environments, highlighting the need for novel techniques that can effectively leverage the static and predictable nature of many HPC communication patterns.

To address the challenges of applying SDN in HPC environments, I introduce techniques that leverage the communication behavior exhibited by HPC applications, specifically focusing on flow identification and communication phase identification. A large number of HPC applications simulate physical processes over numerous time steps, with each time step performing similar tasks that alternate between computation and communication phases. These communication phases often repeat and, in many applications, occur at durations in the order of subseconds or even submilliseconds, making conventional SDN techniques unsuitable due to the overheads incurred when reacting to such fine-grain behavior. However, because these communication patterns are often static and either known to application developers or can be analyzed statically or dynamically, they present an opportunity for SDN systems to optimize their operation. I propose flow identification to accurately classify application flows, with particular focus on elephant flows---those that carry large amounts of data and typically dominate the communication time. Identifying and efficiently scheduling these elephant flows helps address the problem of unbalanced network traffic in HPC applications. Additionally, I distinguish between static and dynamic communications, using application-provided hints through an API to guide flow classification for static patterns, and employing a machine learning--based approach to support flow identification in dynamic cases.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, I conduct extensive simulation experiments using the TraceR-CODES parallel discrete-event simulator on a 3-level Fat-tree topology. These simulations include both static and dynamic communication benchmarks to assess the applicability of the approach across a range of HPC workloads. For static applications such as Stencil4d, which involve near-neighbor communication patterns, the techniques I present result in notable performance improvements. For dynamic applications such as Milc, where different communication patterns are exercised across iterations, the integration of application-level hints and machine learning--based flow identification demonstrates consistent advantages over existing SDN schemes. The evaluation across all three Fat-tree topologies confirms that incorporating communication-aware strategies into the SDN framework improves performance for both predictable and unpredictable communication behaviors. These results highlight the importance of aligning SDN control mechanisms with the underlying structure of HPC communication, particularly in systems where efficient flow management directly influences application scalability.

In summary, I contribute to the ongoing effort of adapting software-defined networking to the unique requirements of high performance computing systems by exploiting the repetitive and predictable communication behaviors of HPC applications. By bridging the gap between general-purpose SDN architectures and the fine-grained, phase-driven communication patterns common in scientific computing, I offer a communication-aware control strategy that enhances flow management in HPC networks. These contributions demonstrate that combining static flow information with dynamic identification mechanisms enables SDN to support both regular and irregular communication patterns, ultimately improving performance in realistic HPC workloads and guiding future directions in adaptive network control.
