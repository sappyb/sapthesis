\chapter{Design and Evaluation of Techniques for HPC platforms with SDN-capable Interconnects} 

Software-defined networking (SDN)~\cite{kreutz2014software} has shown great
promise and has been widely deployed in data centers, campus networks,
and wide-area networks. SDN has the ability to manage traffic at the flow
level using the logically centralized global network view and to optimize
the network resource utilization for global optimality, which may
significantly improve network performance over the traditional networking
infrastructure~\cite{tr2016sdn}.

Although SDN features are also attractive to high performance
computing (HPC) systems and applications, SDN has yet to be widely adopted
in the HPC domain. Existing SDN techniques optimize for Internet
and data-parallel applications (e.g. Hadoop and map-reduce
applications)~\cite{he2016firebird}. The communication characteristics of
HPC applications are different from those of Internet and data-parallel
applications. For example, many HPC applications simulate
physical processes over numerous time steps,
with each time step performing similar tasks: the execution of
such applications exhibits phased behavior with alternating computation
and communication phases. During the computation phases, few communications
are performed; and the communications often repeat themselves in
different time steps. Additionally,
communications in HPC applications are often static in that they are known
to the application developers or can be analyzed statically or dynamically
~\cite{faraj2002communication,hong2013achieving}. Exploring such features
in HPC applications and systems will allow SDN to support
communications more effectively and to perform its tasks more efficiently.

In this work, I develop techniques to adapt SDN to HPC workloads and systems,
taking HPC application characteristics into account. The techniques
include flow identification, phase identification, and flow scheduling.
Flow identification identifies the types of flows
in applications, which is essential
for  an SDN-capable network to achieve high performance.
Phase identification identifies communication phases in applications, which
allows network resources to be utilized more effectively. Flow scheduling
schedules the communication to achieve target optimization objectives.
To maximize the effectiveness, my techniques treat
static and dynamic communications in HPC applications differently.
Dynamic communications are handled using techniques similar to those
in the traditional SDN networks. For static communications, I propose
to enhance SDN with an API for HPC applications
to give hints to the SDN system (e.g. whether a flow is an elephant flow
or will likely be an elephant flow). For such communications,
the network system relies on the upper layer to obtain communication
information. This is similar to the intent-based API \cite{Coflow2012}
where application developer and the network system work
together for flow and phase identification.

I conducted extensive simulation experiments using the
TraceR-CODES
\cite{jain2016evaluating,mubarak2016enabling,jain2017predicting}
PDES ~\cite{fujimoto1990parallel} simulator on a 3-level
fat-tree topology ~\cite{leiserson1985fat} ~\cite{al2008scalable}. My
simulation results reveal that my techniques improve the performance
over the existing SDN
scheme for applications with both static and dynamic communications.
%For example, for the static Stencil4d benchmark with the near neighbor
%communications, my technique improves the performance by around XXXXXX\%.
%For the dynamic Milc benchmark where multiple patterns are
%performed in different iterations, my technique improves over
%existing SDN scheme by XXXXXX\% on average across all three
%fat-tree topologies.
The main contributions of this work include the following:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item I identify the features in HPC applications that can be used
  to enhance the effectiveness of SDN.
\item I develop techniques to adapt SDN to HPC applications and
  systems by exploiting the identified HPC features.
\item I perform extensive simulation to evaluate and validate
  the proposed techniques.
\end{itemize}
