Vendors support several options that can be configured when deploying fat-tree networks on production systems, such as link bandwidth, number of rails, number of planes, and tapering. This paper showcases the use of simulations to compare the impact of these design options on representative production HPC applications, libraries, and multi-job workloads. We present advances in the TraceR-CODES simulation framework that enable this analysis and evaluate its prediction accuracy against experiments on a production fat-tree network. In order to understand the impact of different network configurations on various anticipated scenarios, we study workloads with different communication patterns, computation-to-communication ratios, and scaling characteristics. Using multi-job workloads, we also study the impact of inter-job interference on performance and compare the cost-performance tradeoffs.},

TraceR can be used for predicting network performance and understanding network behavior by simulating messaging on interconnection networks. It addresses two major shortcomings in current network simulators. First, it enables fast and scalable simulations of large-scale supercomputer networks. Second, it can simulate production HPC applications using BigSim's emulation framework. In addition to introducing TraceR, this paper studies the impact of input parameters on simulation performance. We also compare TraceR with other network simulators such as SST and BigSim, and demonstrate TraceR 's scalability using various case studies.",

abstract = {The Dragonfly network organizes routers into groups, with connectivity within each group provided by local links and connectivity between groups provided by global links. The specification of Dragonfly leaves many options for arranging global links. In this work, we study global link arrangement for practical Dragonfly topologies where (1) there are multiple global links connecting each pair of groups, and (2) the global link bandwidth is similar to the local link bandwidth. We found that existing global link arrangement schemes such as the absolute, relative and circulant-based arrangements do not specify an important component in global connectivity for practical Dragonfly, which we call per-router arrangement. Per-router arrangement determines how the global links from each individual router are connected. We integrate per-router arrangement into existing schemes, develop a unified algorithm to compute a large class of global link arrangements for practical Dragonfly, and carry out an extensive simulation study to evaluate different global link arrangement schemes. Our results indicate that the existing understanding of the global link arrangement does not apply to practical Dragonfly: contradict to the existing understanding that global link arrangement does not make significant difference in performance when global links have similar bandwidth as local links, per-router arrangement significantly impacts the network performance of practical Dragonfly. We identify the schemes that yield high performance for practical Dragonfly.},
