The introduction of
GPU-based compute nodes
alters the balance between computation and communication aspects within the
system, shifting the communication-to-computation ratio.
As computation speeds up with the addition of these powerful
nodes, communication fails to scale proportionally. New networking
technologies like Software-Defined Networking (SDN) address
this problem by providing
improved resource management during communication.
This dissertation proposes to leverage SDN to enhance
communication efficiency in HPC environments with GPU-based compute nodes
and to find efficient system configurations for running
HPC applications in these environments. By alleviating communication
bottlenecks, this research aims to facilitate seamless execution of HPC
workloads on SDN-based HPC systems and thereby enable groundbreaking discoveries in scientific computing.
