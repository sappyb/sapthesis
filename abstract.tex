The rise in demand for High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications, driven by
complex scientific computations, poses challenges in optimizing communication
performance, especially in fat-tree-based cloud data centers. This prospectus
proposes integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enhancements into
fat-tree topologies to enhance communication efficiency for HPC applications. By
alleviating communication bottlenecks, this research aims to facilitate seamless
execution of HPC workloads on cloud platforms, thereby enabling groundbreaking
discoveries in scientific computing. Through a comprehensive methodology,
including simulation validation and implementation of SDN routing strategies,
this study seeks to uncover insights into optimizing communication efficiency in
next-generation HPC systems. The findings are anticipated to extend existing
knowledge and influence the design of future supercomputers, paving the way for
enhanced performance in cloud-based HPC environments.
